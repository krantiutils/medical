## Codebase Patterns
- Use symlink for .env in packages/database (`ln -sf ../../.env packages/database/.env`) to allow Prisma to access root .env
- Turborepo tasks that need DATABASE_URL must have the symlink in place
- @types/node is required in packages/database for process.env type support
- Run `pnpm db:generate` before typecheck to ensure Prisma client is generated

## 2026-02-02 01:52 +0545 - US-001
- **What was implemented**: Verified and completed project setup
- **Files changed**:
  - `turbo.json` - Added globalEnv for DATABASE_URL
  - `packages/database/.env` - Created symlink to root .env
  - `packages/database/package.json` - Added @types/node devDependency
  - `prd.json` - Marked US-001 as passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Prisma needs .env file accessible - symlink is cleaner than dotenv-cli
  - Turbo 2.x uses `globalEnv` not `globalDotEnv` for env var declaration
  - The scaffolding was mostly pre-existing, this iteration verified it works
  - Docker needs sudo on this machine (password in CLAUDE.md)
